Applying to PhD programs can be quite a stressful experience. From deciding to pursue a PhD, to choosing a number of programs to apply to, planning applications materials, and polishing various aspects of your application, the process takes significant time and effort. When I applied to PhD programs in the fall of 2021, I had the privilege of having excellent feedback from multiple mentors and friends and interacting with them helped significantly improve my applications. If you're interesting in pursuing research in NLP and considering applying to PhD programs, feel free to reach out to me and I will try to pay the help I got forward.

I'm also sharing some of my application materials here. I hope you find these helpful.
