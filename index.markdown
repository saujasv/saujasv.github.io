Hi! I'm a final-year dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) studying computer science and computational linguistics. I'm broadly interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and program synthesis, and **I'm applying to PhD programs in this admissions cycle**.

As part of my masters thesis, I'm working on [program synthesis for linguistic rules](/projects#program-synthesis-for-linguistic-rules), advised by [Monojit Choudhury](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/monojitc/) and [Dipti Misra Sharma](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/dipti/). I spent the summer of 2021 as a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at [Chandar Research Lab](https://chandar-lab.github.io/) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) working on continual learning for dialogue systems, and continue to collaborate with [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/), [Prasanna Parthasarathi](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~pparth2/) and others. I also work with [Evan Pu](https://evanthebouncy.github.io/) and [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/) on [making program synthesis more pragmatic](/projects#pragmatic-program-synthesis). Check out the [Projects page](/projects) for more information about my work!
