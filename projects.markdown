## Program synthesis for linguistic rules
#### SIGMORPHON Workshop @ ACL 2021

<img src="/assets/images/synthesis_thumbnail.png" width="100%">

Linguistics Olympiad problems are challenging reasoning problems that require a solver to 
infer linguistic rules that generalise from only a few given examples. We use program synthesis
to tackle this problem. We develop a domain-specific language for expressing linguistic rules,
and adapt a synthesis algorithm to synthesise rules for solving a set of phonology problems we curated.
